## About Iranian Classical Music

Iranian classical music is built around a sophisticated modal system called **dastgaah**; think of these as musical universes, each with its own emotional character and melodic patterns yet deeply interconnected. Tonight's performance will take you on a journey through several of these musical worlds, from the passionate Esfahaan to the pastoral Dashti.


## About Darya Ensemble

Darya (pronounced dahr-YAH), meaning "the sea" in Persian, was founded in 1996 through the artistic collaboration between Faraidoun Akhavan and Douglas Hensley. Originally formed as a cultural bridge between traditional Persian music and Canadian audiences, the ensemble has evolved into a sophisticated musical collective dedicated to preserving and reimagining the beauty of Persian classical music.

Named after Keivan Saket's evocative composition "The Sea," Darya embodies the dynamic, ever-changing nature of both the ocean and Persian musical tradition. As the group has grown over nearly three decades, it has welcomed accomplished musicians from diverse backgrounds, creating a rich tapestry of artistic voices united by their passion for Persian classical music.

The ensemble's repertoire spans the full spectrum of Persian musical forms, from traditional folk melodies to contemporary compositions, performed on traditional instruments including tar, setar, santour, ney, kamanche, daf, and vocals. Through their performances across Victoria, Vancouver Island, and beyond, Darya has established itself as a vital cultural ambassador, introducing audiences to the sophisticated and profound expressive depth of Persian musical expression.

With this expansion of talent and instrumentation, Darya continues its mission of preserving classical Persian musical traditions while exploring innovative interpretations that speak to contemporary audiences. The ensemble represents both the timeless beauty of Persian culture and its living, breathing evolution in the Canadian artistic landscape.


## Part 1

- **Pishdaraamad-e Esfahaan**
  - Composer: Ali Asghar Bahari (1905-1995)
  - *A pishdaraamad is an opening composition that introduces a dastgaah's character. This haunting piece comes from one of the 20th century's most revered kamanche masters, Bahari, who was renowned for his revolutionary approach to cross-modal improvisation and his ability to seamlessly weave between dastgahs with such skill that even expert listeners couldn't detect the transitions. This masterpiece of melodic storytelling through melody moves through contemplative opening passages into more passionate questioning, before arriving at a complex resolution that balances longing with acceptance. It invites you into an intimate musical conversation that will linger in your heart long after the final note.*

- **Tasnif-e Darya** (*The Sea*)
  - Composer: Keivan Saket (b. 1961)
  - *Tasnifs are rhythmic songs with poetry, often expressing themes of love, nature, or mysticism. This piece lends its name to our ensemble, creating a vivid musical seascape that captures the ocean's ever-changing moods. Saket masterfully paints the sea's transformation from tranquil calm to dramatic storms and back to serene stillness. The poetry warns us to remain as dynamic and alive as the sea itself, lest we become stagnant pools; dreaming of hearts that flow like tidewater, souls as boundless and ever-changing as the waters themselves.*

- **Saaz-o Aavaaz-e Shushtari**
  - *Saaz-o Aavaaz are free-flowing musical conversations between voice and instruments, unbound by rhythm. In these intimate dialogues, singer and instrumentalist complete each other's musical thoughts, pose questions and offer answers, and guide each other through melodic journeys. This improvised exploration of the Shushtari mode features vocal accompanied by setar.*

- **Chahaarmezraab-e Shushtari**
  - Composer: Keivan Saket (b. 1961)
  - *Chahaarmezraabs are fast-paced, rhythmic pieces with recurring motifs often played early or mid-concert, with changing modes. This highly technical piece showcases intricate musical details and virtuosic playing. Contemporary master of tar and setar, university professor, and author of 12 instructional books, Saket collaborated with legendary masters including Parviz Meshkatian in the renowned Aref Ensemble, and founded both the Vaziri Orchestra and his own 60-piece ensemble. Known for his innovative fusion of traditional Persian forms with Western classical arrangements.*

- **Saaz-o Aavaaz-e Homaayun**
  - *Free improvisation exploring Homaayun's melodic possibilities, featuring vocal accompanied by santour and violin. Homaayun evokes deep contemplation and existential reflection; a contemplative mode that draws the listener into profound thoughts, distinct from the longing or romantic yearning found in other modes.*

- **Tasnif-e Aghrabe Zolfe Kajet** (*The Scorpion Curls of Your Hair*)
  - Composer: Aliakbar Sheyda (c. 1843-1906)
  - *A master of the Qajar era, Sheyda was a Renaissance figure; poet, calligrapher, musician, and setar player born in Shiraz. He served as a government administrator before migrating to Tehran, where he was initiated into mystical circles. Known as one of the most celebrated tasnif composers of the classical Qajar style, this piece captures the intoxicating danger of love through the metaphor of the beloved's curls as beautiful yet potentially deadly scorpion tails.*

- **Tasnif-e Aasemoon Be In Gapi** (*The Sky of Such Expanse*)
  - Folk music of Shiraz
  - *Folk music forms the vibrant heart of Iranian cultural life, with each region offering its own treasure trove of songs, melodies, and traditions passed down through generations. This rich tapestry of regional music has profoundly influenced formal dastgaahi music; many gushes (melodic sections) within each dastgah trace their origins back to these folk traditions. This beautiful piece from Shiraz represents the living connection between Iran's formal classical tradition and its folk roots, carrying within it the voice of the people and the poetry of everyday life.*


## Part 2

- **Chahaarmezraab-e Dashti**
  - Based on an etude by Jalil Shahnaz (1921-2013), arranged by Siamak Aghaei
  - *The legendary "God of tar," as fellow musicians called him; Shahnaz revolutionized Persian classical music through his virtuosic technique and painterly ability to create vivid musical imagery. Born in Isfahan to a musical family, he became the defining voice of the tar for over six decades, collaborating with masters like Mohammad Reza Shajarian, who declared: "Like Hafez, he is unrepeatable." This virtuosic chahaarmezraab in the popular Dashti mode showcases the rhythmic brilliance that made Shahnaz a legend.*

- **Saaz-o Aavaaz-e Dashti**
  - *Free improvisation exploring Dashti's melodic possibilities, featuring vocal accompanied by ney and violin. Dashti evokes the open countryside and rural landscapes; a mode that carries the spirit of vast plains, distant horizons, and the timeless connection between people and the land. Sometimes called the second "Shur" mode, sharing many similarities with Shur while maintaining its own distinct character and uniqueness.*

- **Tasnif-e Ey Aamaan** (*Oh Refuge*)
  - Composer: Faramarz Payvar (1933-2009)
  - *A heartfelt plea for sanctuary from the ache of separation; the poet cries out for refuge from the loneliness that comes when the beloved is away. This piece is in the mode Shur, one of the most beloved and fundamental dastgaahs in Persian music, known for its deeply moving and expressive character that perfectly captures themes of longing and spiritual yearning.*

- **Pishdaraamad-e Abuataa**
  - Composer: Faramarz Payvar (1933-2009)
  - *Payvar revolutionized the santour from a marginal instrument into a virtuosic centerpiece, documenting hundreds of songs from past masters while composing countless new works. His genius lay in creating sophisticated instrumental arrangements that introduced polyphony into Persian music while maintaining profound emotional depth. This pishdaraamad serves as an introduction to the mystical Abuataa mode.*

- **Saaz-o Aavaaz-e Abuataa**
  - *Vocal accompanied by tar. Abuataa is closely related to Shur and often used to express joy and happiness, while maintaining deep spiritual undertones. The mode carries an air of mystery and contemplation, making it perfect for exploring the profound connection between earthly emotions and divine transcendence.*

- **Tasnif-e Baa Man Sanama** (*With Me, My Beloved*)
  - Composer: Faramarz Payvar (1933-2009)
  - *Performed in the gushe Hejaaz from mode Abuataa, this piece demonstrates the sophisticated modal relationships in Persian music through a delicate interplay between sound and silence, where what is not played becomes as expressive as what is. In this restrained musical landscape, the lover stands completely exposed; willingly captured by dark, knowing eyes, surrendering pride and reason at beauty's feet. Yet in this surrender lies its own strange power, a victory found in choosing to be conquered by what moves us most deeply.*

- **Reng-e Dashti**
  - Composer: Reza Mahjoubi, with additions by Abolhassan Saba
  - *Rengs are rhythmic concluding pieces, traditionally created to be accompanied by dance, and usually non-repetitive. The lover rests beside flowing water, knowing that petals scatter and wine eventually sours, but in this moment lives music and beauty and the precious possibility that love might linger just a little longer.*
