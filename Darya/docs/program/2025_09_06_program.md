Welcome to a transformative journey through Persian classical music.

## About Iranian Classical Music

Iranian classical music is built around a sophisticated modal system called **dastgaah**; think of these as musical universes, each with its own emotional character and melodic patterns yet deeply interconnected. Tonight's performance will take you on a journey through several of these musical worlds, from the passionate Esfahaan to the pastoral Dashti.


## About Darya Ensemble

Darya (pronounced dahr-YAH), meaning "the sea" in Persian, was founded in 1996 through the artistic collaboration between Faraidoun Akhavan and Douglas Hensley. Originally formed as a cultural bridge between traditional Persian music and Canadian audiences, the ensemble has evolved into a sophisticated musical collective dedicated to preserving and reimagining the beauty of Persian classical music.

Named after Keivan Saket's evocative composition "The Sea," Darya embodies the dynamic, ever-changing nature of both the ocean and Persian musical tradition. As the group has grown over nearly three decades, it has welcomed accomplished musicians from diverse backgrounds, creating a rich tapestry of artistic voices united by their passion for Persian classical music.

The ensemble's repertoire spans the full spectrum of Persian musical forms, from traditional folk melodies to contemporary compositions, performed on traditional instruments including tar, setar, santour, ney, kamanche, daf, and vocals. Through their performances across Victoria, Vancouver Island, and beyond, Darya has established itself as a vital cultural ambassador, introducing audiences to the sophisticated and profound expressive depth of Persian musical expression.

With this expansion of talent and instrumentation, Darya continues its mission of preserving classical Persian musical traditions while exploring innovative interpretations that speak to contemporary audiences. The ensemble represents both the timeless beauty of Persian culture and its living, breathing evolution in the Canadian artistic landscape.
